# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

I already generated the previous response in markdown. Would you like me to make any changes to it?

## ðŸš€ Deploying to GitHub Pages (Single-File Method)

This guide outlines a clean method for deploying your React Vite Single-Page Application (SPA) to GitHub Pages by bundling all assets into a single `index.html` file and serving the build directory directly from the `main` branch, avoiding the `gh-pages` package.

### Prerequisites

You must first install and configure the `vite-plugin-singlefile`.

1.  **Install Plugin:**

    ```bash
    npm install -D vite-plugin-singlefile
    npm install -D vite-plugin-svgr
    ```

2.  **Update `vite.config.js` (or `.ts`):**
    Ensure your configuration includes the plugin as shown below:

    ```javascript
    import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
    import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
    import { viteSingleFile } from 'vite-plugin-singlefile';
    import { viteSingleFile } from 'vite-plugin-singlefile';

    export default defineConfig({
      plugins: [
        react(), 
        viteSingleFile(),
        svgr(),        
      ],

      build: {
        // Ensure this is set to your build folder
        outDir: 'dist', 
      },
    });
    ```

### Deployment Steps

Follow these steps to deploy your application:

1.  **Enable `dist/` in Git:**
    Open your **`.gitignore`** file and ensure the line that ignores the build output folder (usually `/dist`) is **removed** so that the compiled assets are tracked and pushed to the repository.

2.  **Run Build:**
    Execute your build command to generate the final output files, including the bundled `index.html`, in the `dist` folder:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

3.  **Commit and Push:**
    Commit the new `dist/` folder and push your changes to the `main` branch of your GitHub repository.

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Build and push dist folder for deployment"
    git push origin main
    ```

4.  **Configure GitHub Pages:**
    Navigate to your GitHub repository and go to **Settings** -\> **Pages**.

      * Under **Source**, select the **`main`** branch.
      * Under the folder dropdown, explicitly select the **`/dist`** folder.
      * Click **Save**.

Your application should be deployed and accessible via the GitHub Pages URL after a few moments.
